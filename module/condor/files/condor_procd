#   - on Windows, this will be a named pipe as well (but named pipes on

# The procd currently uses a very simplistic logging system. Since this
# log will not be rotated like other Condor logs, it is only recommended
# to set PROCD_LOG when attempting to debug a problem. In other Condor
# daemons, turning on D_PROCFAMILY will result in that daemon logging
# all of its interactions with the ProcD.
